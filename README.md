Description: Stores temporal and variable data during program execution.
Properties: Storage capacity from minimum to infinite, dynamically adjusting according to requirements.
Non-Volatile Memory (ROM, Flash):
Description: Stores firmware and software that does not change frequently.
Properties: Storage capacity from minimal to infinite, allowing expansion as needed.
3. Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces
Description: They allow communication with other devices and peripherals.
Properties: Number and type of interfaces from minimum to infinite, adapting to the number and type of peripherals connected.
4. Storage
Description: Persistently saves data and programs.
Properties: Storage capacity from minimal to infinite, scaling according to data requirements.
5. Device Drivers
Description: They manage the communication between the operating system and the hardware.
Properties: Number and type of controllers from minimum to infinite, allowing the integration of any type of hardware.
6. Power Systems
Description: They provide power to the device.
Properties: Minimum to infinite power supply capacity, adjusting to the energy needs of the system.
